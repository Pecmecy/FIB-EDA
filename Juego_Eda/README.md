# EDA Game

Project developed for the Data Structures and Algorythms subject from the Computer Science degree at FIB UPC. 

# Content

The game is based on The Walking Dead series. The idea is simple: 4 players control their respectives units and try to obtain as many points as possible through 200 rounds. Points are obtained by killing zombies and enemy units, getting food or controlling tiles of the map.
The rest of the rules are explained in the PDF.

In the game folder there are several .cc codes. The last version, the one that got to round 149, is AINose.cc.. The rest of codes are both early versions and WIPs or mandatory code for the game to work. 

# Result

The overall mark was a 8.06, my player got to round 149/242.
